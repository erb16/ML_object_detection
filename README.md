# Machine Learning object prediction and object detection models.

This project was created for the CFG Machine Learning Sprint. It uses ImageAi and PyTorch to classify images.

The object prediction file is able to make a prediction on a single-object image.
The object detection file is able to predict multiple objects within an image.

You will need to download an object detection model such as RetinaNet (or YOLOv3 or TinyYOLOv3), and save them within the project folder.
